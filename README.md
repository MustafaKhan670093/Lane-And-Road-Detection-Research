## Introduction

The focus of this research project is on the development of a complex hand gesture recognition system that can interface with a website, games and a robot all using the built-in webcam of a computer. In this currently on going project, I am responsible for researching contemporary machine learning approaches to achieving this goal, find an appropriate dataset and developing a model and train it to have a high performance accuracy. I am conducting the research work and development with a group of dedicated students in the University Of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team.

Currently we are developing the components needed for the final system in a modular fashion and will be integrating these parts by Feb-March of 2021. We aim to submit our insight and work at a conference!
